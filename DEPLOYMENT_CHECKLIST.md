# MediRemind Complete System Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures your entire MediRemind system (Frontend + Backend + Database) is properly configured for Render deployment.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration
- [x] PostgreSQL database configured in `render.yaml`
- [x] Database plan set to `free`
- [x] Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- [x] Django database settings updated to use `dj-database-url`

### üîß Backend Configuration
- [x] Django settings optimized for production
- [x] `DEBUG=false` in production
- [x] `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configured for Render
- [x] WhiteNoise middleware for static files
- [x] CORS settings configured for frontend
- [x] Health check endpoint at `/health/`
- [x] Gunicorn configured with proper port binding
- [x] Build script optimized for free tier

### üé® Frontend Configuration
- [x] React build process configured
- [x] Environment variables for API URL
- [x] No hardcoded localhost URLs
- [x] Production environment file created
- [x] Static site deployment configured

### üîó Service Integration
- [x] Frontend configured to use backend API URL
- [x] Backend configured with frontend URL for CORS
- [x] Environment variables linked between services
- [x] Both services in same region (oregon)

## üìã Deployment Services Overview

### 1. Database Service
```yaml
Name: mediremind-db
Type: PostgreSQL
Plan: Free (1GB storage)
Region: Oregon
```

### 2. Backend Service
```yaml
Name: mediremind-backend
Type: Web Service
Runtime: Python
Plan: Free (750 hours/month)
Region: Oregon
Health Check: /health/
```

### 3. Frontend Service
```yaml
Name: mediremind-frontend
Type: Static Site
Runtime: Node.js (build only)
Plan: Free (unlimited)
Region: Oregon
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure all code is committed and pushed
2. **Create Blueprint**: 
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will detect `render.yaml`
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Add any missing environment variables
4. **Deploy**: Render will automatically create all services

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. **Create Database**: PostgreSQL service first
2. **Create Backend**: Web service with database connection
3. **Create Frontend**: Static site with backend API URL
4. **Link Services**: Configure environment variables between services

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend Verification
- [ ] Backend service is running
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/health/`
- [ ] Database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Static files are served correctly
- [ ] Admin panel accessible (if needed)

### Frontend Verification
- [ ] Frontend site loads correctly
- [ ] API calls work (check browser network tab)
- [ ] User registration/login functions
- [ ] Appointment scheduling works
- [ ] No console errors related to API calls

### Integration Verification
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] CORS headers are properly configured
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Data persistence works (create/read/update/delete)

## üîß Environment Variables Required

### Backend Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=<auto-generated-by-render>
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<auto-generated-by-render>
DEBUG=false
ENVIRONMENT=production
REDIS_URL=<your-redis-url>
FRONTEND_URL=<auto-linked-from-frontend-service>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-sendgrid-key>
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=<your-email>
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-secret>
```

### Frontend Environment Variables
```
VITE_API_URL=<auto-linked-from-backend-service>
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<auto-linked-from-backend-service>
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Service Won't Start
- **Check**: Build logs for errors
- **Solution**: Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt/package.json

### Issue: Database Connection Failed
- **Check**: DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Solution**: Ensure database service is running and linked

### Issue: Frontend Can't Reach Backend
- **Check**: VITE_API_URL environment variable
- **Solution**: Verify backend service URL is correct

### Issue: CORS Errors
- **Check**: FRONTEND_URL in backend environment
- **Solution**: Ensure frontend URL is properly linked

### Issue: Static Files Not Loading
- **Check**: WhiteNoise configuration
- **Solution**: Run `python manage.py collectstatic`

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Free Tier Monitoring
- **Service Sleep**: Backend sleeps after 15 minutes
- **Database Usage**: Monitor 1GB storage limit
- **Monthly Hours**: Track 750-hour limit

### Performance Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Monitor `/health/` endpoint
- **Response Times**: Check for cold start delays
- **Error Rates**: Monitor application logs

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Upgrade when approaching 1GB limit
- **Backend**: Upgrade to prevent service sleep
- **Frontend**: Always free, no scaling needed

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ All three services are running (database, backend, frontend)
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads and displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Users can register and log in
- ‚úÖ Appointments can be created and managed
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in service logs
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK

**Next Steps**: After successful deployment, consider setting up monitoring, backups, and a custom domain for your production system.
