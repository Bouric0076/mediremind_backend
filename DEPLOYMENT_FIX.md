# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The deployment failed with error: `bash: line 1: ./build.sh: No such file or directory`

## Root Cause
The build script `./build.sh` was not executable on the Linux environment used by Render.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Build Command Fix
**File**: `render.yaml`
**Change**: Updated build command from `"./build.sh"` to `"bash build.sh"`
**Reason**: This explicitly calls bash to execute the script instead of relying on executable permissions.

### 2. Service Property Fix
**File**: `render.yaml`
**Change**: Updated `fromService` property from `host` to `url`
**Reason**: Ensures proper URL generation for service-to-service communication.

## Changes Made

```yaml
# Before
buildCommand: "./build.sh"
property: host

# After  
buildCommand: "bash build.sh"
property: url
```

## Verification
- ✅ Build script commands tested locally
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Static files collect successfully
- ✅ Configuration syntax validated

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub to trigger new deployment
3. Monitor deployment logs for success

## Expected Result
The deployment should now succeed and all three services (database, backend, frontend) should be created and linked properly.
